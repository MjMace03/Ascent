# Ascent

This is a repository for the "Ascent" website. A 2nd year group project made to advertise the fictional game "Ascent" as our output for the course, Applications Development and Emerging Technologies. 

My role in this project was primarily as the UI/UX Designer of the website. I also created the character designs, assets, and contributed in the world-building and other contents for Ascent.  

The website itself was created by my fellow group members, who deserves the most recognition for the completion of the project. Without them, this website and Ascent as a whole would not exist. Maxine, Gessa, Carl, and Yesha.

This project served as my first practical application of web development concepts, where I gained initial hands-on experience in creating a functional website.
